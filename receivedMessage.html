[House and Wilson are walking through the hallway. All you can see is their hands and legs, showing that House is using a cane and limping. Wilson is the only one of the two wearing a lab coat.]

Wilson: 29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.

House: See that? They all assume Iâ€™m a patient because of this cane.

Wilson: So put on a white coat like the rest of us.

House: I donâ€™t want them to think Iâ€™m a doctor.

Wilson: You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude.

House: People donâ€™t want a sick doctor.

Wilson: Fair enough. I donâ€™t like healthy patients. The 29 year old femaleâ€¦

House: The one who canâ€™t talk, I liked that part.

Wilson: Sheâ€™s my cousin.

House: And your cousin doesnâ€™t like the diagnosis. I wouldnâ€™t either. Brain tumor, sheâ€™s gonna die, boring.

Wilson: No wonder youâ€™re such a renowned diagnostician. You donâ€™t need to actually know anything to figure out whatâ€™s wrong.

House: Youâ€™re the oncologist; Iâ€™m just a lowly infectious disease guy.

Wilson: Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.

House: Sheâ€™s 29. Whatever sheâ€™s got is highly unlikely.

Wilson: Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.

House: Thatâ€™s an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.

Wilson: No family history.

House: I thought your uncle died of cancer.

Wilson: Other side. No environmental factors.

House: That you know of.

Wilson: And sheâ€™s not responding to radiation treatment.

House: None of which is even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?

Wilson: Come on! Why leave all the fun for the coroner? Whatâ€™s the point of putting together a team if youâ€™re not going to use them? Youâ€™ve got three overqualified doctors working for you. Getting bored.

[Cut to Rebecca, into the nose, and up the blood stream. Cut to House looking through an MRI of Rebeccaâ€™s head.]

Foreman: Itâ€™s a lesion.

House: And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.

Foreman: Shouldnâ€™t we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing?

House: Is she a doctor?

Foreman: No, butâ€¦

House: Everybody lies.

Cameron: Dr. House doesnâ€™t like dealing with patients.

Foreman: Isnâ€™t treating patients why we became doctors?

House: No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.

Foreman: So youâ€™re trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine.

House: If we donâ€™t talk to them they canâ€™t lie to us, and we canâ€™t lie to them. Humanity is overrated. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a tumor.

Foreman: First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think â€œhorsesâ€? not â€œzebrasâ€?.

House: Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, thereâ€™s nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if itâ€™s not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldnâ€™t she talk?

Chase: Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.

House: Get her a contrast MRI.

Cameron: Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.

Chase: Mad cow?

House: Mad zebra.

Foreman: Wernickie's encephalopathy?

House: No, blood thiamine level was normal.

Foreman: Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume itâ€™s a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.

House: Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Letâ€™s find out what kind of zebra weâ€™re dealing with here.

[Cut to House standing at the elevator, he sees Cuddy and presses the down button twice]

Cuddy: I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.

House: Really? Well, thatâ€™s odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.

Cuddy: You think we have nothing to talk about?

House: No, just that I canâ€™t think of anything that Iâ€™d be interested in.

Cuddy: I sign your paychecks.

House: I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?

Cuddy: That would be juvenile.

[Both enter the elevator]

Cuddy: I can still fire you if youâ€™re not doing your job.

House: Iâ€™m here from 9 to 5.

Cuddy: Your billings are practically nonexistent.

House: Rough year.

Cuddy: You ignore requests for consults.

House: I call back. Sometimes I misdial.

Cuddy: Youâ€™re 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.

House: See, I was right, this doesnâ€™t interest me.

Cuddy: 6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.

House: Itâ€™s 5:00. Iâ€™m going home.

Cuddy: To what?

House: Nice.

Cuddy: Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I donâ€™t fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.

House: Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You arenâ€™t going to fire me.

Cuddy: Your reputation wonâ€™t last up if you donâ€™t do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.

House: Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, â€œYou canâ€™t always get what you want.â€?

[Scene of hospital from above, cut to hallway, Rebecca in wheelchair with Cameron, Chase, and Foreman around.]

Rebecca: Youâ€™re not my doctor. Are you Dr. House?

Chase: Thankfully no. Iâ€™m Dr. Chase.

Cameron: Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine. Heâ€™s very busy, but he has taken a keen interest in your case.
[Cut to MRI room, Rebecca is on the table]

Foreman: We inject gadolinium into a vein. It distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery.

Cameron: Basically, whateverâ€™s in your head, lights up like a Christmas tree.

Foreman: It might make you feel a little light-headed.

Nurse: Dr. Cameron. Iâ€™m sorry I have to stop you, thereâ€™s a problem.

[Cut to House, busting into Cuddyâ€™s office]

House: You pulled my authorization.

Cuddy: Yes, why are you yelling?

House: No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.

Cuddy: You also canâ€™t make long distance phone calls.

House: If youâ€™re gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.

Cuddy: Or photocopies; youâ€™re still yelling.

House: Iâ€™m ANGRY! Youâ€™re risking a patientâ€™s life.

Cuddy: I assume those are two separate points.

House: You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as Iâ€™m still work here you haveâ€¦[interrupted]

Cuddy: Is your yelling designed to scare me because Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m supposed to be scared of. More yelling? Thatâ€™s not scary. That youâ€™re gonna hurt me? Thatâ€™s scary, but Iâ€™m pretty sure I can outrun ya.

Cuddy: Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and youâ€™re right, â€œYou canâ€™t always get what you want,â€? but as it turns out â€œif you try sometimes you get what you need.â€?

House: So, because you want me to treat patients, you arenâ€™t letting me treat patients.

Cuddy: I need you to do your job.

[House comes out of Cuddyâ€™s office; Wilson and the ducklings are there]

House: Do the MRI, she folded. [Ducklings leave, House turns to Wilson] Iâ€™ve gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time Iâ€™ve missed. 2054. Iâ€™ll be caught up in 2054. [He walks into the clinic] You better love this cousin a whole lot.

[Cut back to MRI room Rebecca is back on the table. She is pushed into the machine.]

Cameron: All right Rebecca, [over intercom] we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there, but we need you to remain still.

Chase: [over intercom] Ok, weâ€™re gonna begin.

[Machine starts up and makes weird sounds]

Rebecca: I donâ€™t feel so good.

Chase: Itâ€™s all right. Just try to relax.

[Rebecca starts choking. Cool shot of inside her throat. You can see that it closes up]

Cameron: Rebecca? [over intercom] Rebecca? [back in booth] Rebecca! Get her out of there.

Chase: Ah she probably fell asleep; sheâ€™s exhausted.

Cameron: She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago, sheâ€™s not sleeping. We gotta get her out of there!

Chase: Itâ€™ll just be another minute.

Cameron: Sheâ€™s having an allergic reaction to gadolinium. Sheâ€™ll be dead in two minutes.

Foreman: Hold her neck.

Cameron: Oh, sheâ€™s ashen.

Foreman: Sheâ€™s not breathing. Epi point five.

Cameron: Come on, I canâ€™t ventilate.

Foreman: Too much edema, whereâ€™s the surgical airway kit?

Chase: Yep, coming.

[Cool cutting into Rebeccaâ€™s neck sounds, and real colored blood for a change. They get her bagged.]

Chase: Good call.

(And weâ€™re back to commercialsâ€¦blahâ€¦)
[Cut into hospital room, next day. Rebecca has a ventilator hooked up to her, and the ducklings are present]

Chase: Weâ€™ll get that tube out of your throat later today.

Cameron: Just get some rest for now.

[They leave to hallway, House is there.]

House: Told you, canâ€™t trust people.

Cameron: She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.

House: Canâ€™t get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.

Foreman: You actually want me to talk to the patient? Get a history?

House: We need to know if thereâ€™s some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.

Foreman: I thought everybody lied?

House: Truth begins in lies. Think about it.

Foreman: That doesnâ€™t mean anything,does it?

[House walks away]

[House enters the clinicâ€¦dun dun dun!]

House: 12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.

Cuddy: No TV, but weâ€™ve got patients.

House: Canâ€™t you give out the aspirin yourself? Iâ€™ll do paperwork.

Cuddy: I made sure your first case was an interesting one.

House: Cough just wonâ€™t go away, runny nose looks a funny color.

Cuddy: Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.

House: I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Cuddy: Patient is orange.

House: The color?

Cuddy: No, the fruit.

House: You mean yellow; itâ€™s jaundice.

Cuddy: I mean orange.

House: Well, how orange?

Cuddy: Exam room 1.

[Cut to House in exam room 1 with Orange Guy]

Orange Guy: I was playing golf and my cleat got stuck. I mean, it hurt a little but I kept playing. The next morning I could barely stand up. Well, youâ€™re smiling so I take it that means this isnâ€™t serious.

[House takes out his pills]

Orange Guy: Whatâ€™s that? What are you doing?

House: Painkillers.

Orange Guy: Oh, for you, for your leg.

House: No, â€˜cause theyâ€™re yummy. You want one? Itâ€™ll make your back feel better.

[Guy nods and House gives him a painkiller]

House: Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem. Your wife is having an affair.

Orange Guy: What?!

House: Youâ€™re orange, you moron! Itâ€™s one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasnâ€™t picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, sheâ€™s just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?

[Guy nods]

House: The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good lawyer.

[House leaves the room]

[Cut to House in another exam room, this time with a little boy]

House: Deep breath.

Little boy: Itâ€™s cold.

House: Has he been using his inhaler?

Mother: Not in the past few days. Heâ€™s, um, only ten. I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently.

Little boy: What happened to your leg?

[After saying this the little boy starts to wheeze a little, and continues throughout the entire time that House is talking.]

House: Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, donâ€™t you think? Ok, Iâ€™m gonna assume that no bodyâ€™s ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your childâ€™s airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroidsâ€¦stop the inflammation. The more often this happensâ€¦[trails off and starts to leave the room]

Mother: What? â€œThe more often this happensâ€¦â€?what?â€?

House: Forget it. If you donâ€™t trust steroids, you shouldnâ€™t trust doctors.

[House leaves]

[Cut to Rebeccaâ€™s room]

Rebecca: My mother passed away three years ago. She had a heart attack, and my father broke his back doing construction.

[Cameronâ€™s pager goes off]

Cameron: Itâ€™s House, itâ€™s urgent. Iâ€™m sorry.

[They go outside the room and see House waiting for them there]

Cameron: You couldnâ€™t have knocked?

House: Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.

Foreman: Youâ€™re looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus.

Cameron: Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.

House: So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.

Foreman: Mildly.

Cameron: That could mean anything, or nothing.

House: Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that itâ€™s vasculitus except that it could be.

If the blood vessels were inflamed thatâ€™s gonna look exactly like what we saw on the MRI from Trenton County, and the pressureâ€™s gonna cause neurological symptoms.

Cameron: You canâ€™t diagnose that without a biopsy.

House: Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that weâ€™re right.

Cameron: And if weâ€™re wrong?

House: We learn something else.

[Cut to overview of hospital, and then back into Rebeccaâ€™s room]

Rebecca: Why steroids?

Chase: Just part of your treatment. You havenâ€™t had many visitors. No boyfriend?

Rebecca: Three dates. I wouldnâ€™t have stood by him if her were vomiting all day.

Chase: Well, what abut work? You must have friends from work.

Rebecca: Pretty much everybody I like is 5 years old. A nurse said youâ€™re stopping my radiation.

Chase: Weâ€™re just trying some alternative medications. So, whereâ€™s your family from then?

Rebecca: Steroids arenâ€™t an alternative to radiation.

Chase: The tests werenâ€™t really conclusive.

Cameron: Weâ€™re treating you for vasculitus, itâ€™s the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.

Rebecca: Itâ€™s not a tumor? I donâ€™t have a tumor?

[Cut to hallway with Cameron and Chase]

Chase: You should have told her the truth. Itâ€™s a long shot guess.

Cameron: [to nurse] Thank you. [To Chase] If House is right, no harm, if heâ€™s wrong weâ€™ve given a dying woman a couple days hope.

Chase: False hope.

Cameron: If there was any other type available I would have given her that.

[Cut to classroom where Foreman is smelling the floor]

Sidney: Why are you smelling Billyâ€™s pants?

Foreman: Iâ€™m not.

Sidney: Looked like you were.

Foreman: I was smelling the floor.

Sidney: Oh.

Foreman: Do you have any pets in this class?

Sidney: No, but we used to have a gerbil, but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

Foreman: Careless.

Sidney: Do you need to smell it?

Foreman: No, Iâ€™m smelling for mold. I donâ€™t need to smell it.

Sidney: You can smell our parrot.

Foreman: You said you didnâ€™t have any pets in this class.

Sidney: A parrot is a bird.

[Cut to House and Foreman eating lunch with some Soap on the TV that has Houseâ€™s attention more than Foreman does]

Foreman: Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.

House: Itâ€™s not the parrot.

Foreman: Psitticosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications.

House: How many kids were there in the class?

Foreman: 20.

House: How many are home sick?

Foreman: None, butâ€¦

House: None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. Youâ€™ve been through her home?

Foreman: She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.

House: Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?

Foreman: Itâ€™s not a crime scene.

House: Far as I know sheâ€™s running a Meth Lab out of her basement.

Foreman: Sheâ€™s a kindergarten teacher!

House: And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly. [Sigh] Ok, Iâ€™ll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if youâ€™re sick, but if youâ€™re making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isnâ€™t hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the patientâ€™s home for contaminants, garbage, medicationâ€¦[interrupted]

Foreman: Whoa, oh, I canâ€™t just break into someoneâ€™s house.

House: Isnâ€™t that how you got into the Felkerâ€™s home? [pause] Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.

Foreman: I should thank him?

House: Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when youâ€™re being conned, knows how to con.

Foreman: I should sue you!

House: Iâ€™m pretty sure you canâ€™t sue somebody for wrongful hiring.

Foreman: But Iâ€™m pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some ladyâ€™s house.

[Foreman eats the rest of the sandwich]
