If the  requested URI asks for a size less than 100, or for a size greater than 20,000, 
or if the URL is not an integer, your server should not return any document, 
but instead it should return a "Bad Request" message with error code 400. 


If the method in request message is not GET, the server 
would return “Not Implemented” (501) for valid HTTP methods other than GET, or “Bad 
Request” (400) for invalid methods. 

GET /1500 HTTP/1.0

Wilson: 29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.

House: See that? They all assume Iâ??m a patient because of this cane.
